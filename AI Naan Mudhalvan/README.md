# chatbot using python

This is a project of Chatbot using python Naan Mudhalvan Course.

**Problem Statement:** 

Develop a Python-based chatbot capable of engaging in text-based conversations 
with users, providing helpful information, answering questions, and assisting with specific tasks 
based on user input.

## Project Steps


**Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking**

Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking

In this phase, we'll define the problem statement, understand the requirements, and plan the design of our AI-powered spam classifier.

**Problem Definition:** Develop a Python-based chatbot capable of engaging in text-based conversations 
with users, providing helpful information, answering questions, and assisting with specific tasks 
based on user input.

**Design Thinking:**

1. Empathize: Understand User Needs
 - Conduct user research to understand the target audience, their needs, pain points, 
and goals.
 - Create user personas to represent different user types and their characteristics.
 - Gather insights through interviews, surveys, and observations to identify potential 
chatbot use cases.
2. Define: Clearly Define the Problem
 - Based on the user research, define a clear problem statement that the chatbot will 
address.
 - Identify the specific tasks or issues the chatbot will help users with.
 - Set specific goals and success criteria for the chatbot project.
3. Ideate: Generate Innovative Solutions
 - Brainstorm creative ideas for the chatbot's features, functionality, and capabilities.
 - Encourage collaboration among team members to generate a variety of concepts.
 - Explore different ways the chatbot can solve user problems and enhance their 
experience.
4. Prototype: Build a Low-Fidelity Model
- Create a basic, low-fidelity prototype of the chatbot using Python. This can be a 
simple command-line interface or a basic chatbot without advanced features.
 - Focus on the core functionality and user interactions.
 - Use mock data or predefined responses for testing.
5. Test: Gather Feedback and Iterate
 - Test the prototype with potential users or stakeholders to gather feedback.
 - Identify areas for improvement, usability issues, and user preferences.
 - Iterate on the chatbot's design and functionality based on user feedback.
6. Develop: Build the Chatbot in Python
 - Once you have a validated prototype, begin developing the chatbot using Python.
 - Choose the appropriate libraries or frameworks for natural language understanding 
(NLU) and generation.
 - Implement the chatbot's features, logic, and interactions based on the design.
7. Test Again: Ensure Functionality and User Experience
 - Conduct thorough testing of the chatbot at various development stages.
 - Test for functionality, usability, and user satisfaction.
 - Address any bugs, errors, or issues that arise during testing.
8. Deploy: Release the Chatbot
 - Deploy the chatbot on your chosen platform (e.g., website, messaging app).
 - Monitor its performance and gather real user feedback.
 - Continuously improve and update the chatbot based on user interactions and 
feedback.
9. Evaluate: Measure and Optimize
 - Collect and analyze data on the chatbot's usage, user satisfaction, and effectiveness.
 - Use analytics to identify areas for improvement and optimization.
 - Make iterative updates to enhance the chatbot's capabilities and user experience.
10. Scale and Maintain: Ensure Long-Term Success
 - Plan for the long-term maintenance and scalability of the chatbot.
 - Train the chatbot on new data and expand its capabilities over time.
 - Stay updated with advancements in NLP and AI to incorporate new features and 
technologies


**Phase 2: Innovation**

In this phase, we'll explore innovative techniques and approaches to building our chatbot using python.

One innovative technique we can explore is using pre-trained language models like BERT for feature extraction. These models have demonstrated superior performance in NLP tasks.

**Phase 3: Development**

In this phase, we'll start building the core components of our chatbot using python

**Phase 4: Development**

In this phase, we'll continue building our chatbot using python by selecting a machine learning algorithm, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

**Phase 5: Project Documentation & Submission**

In this phase, we'll document the entire project and prepare it for submission
